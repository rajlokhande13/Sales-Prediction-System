Superstore Sales Prediction – Machine Learning Regression Project

This is a Machine Learning Regression project where I developed a predictive system to estimate sales for a Superstore. The model analyzes historical retail data and helps identify which products, regions, categories, and customer segments contribute positively to business performance. This enables efficient decision-making and targeted strategies to improve overall sales and profitability.

The dataset contains attributes such as:
1. Row ID
2. Order ID
3. Order Date
4. Ship Date
5. Ship Mode
6. Customer ID
7. Customer Name
8. Segment
9. Country
10. City
11. State
12. Postal Code
13. Region
14. Product ID
15. Category
16. Sub-Category
17. Product Name
18. Sales
19. Quantity
20. Discount
21. Profit

The objective is to build a model that predicts the Sales value based on these features.

Target Variable: Sales (Numerical continuous value representing the revenue generated from each order)

The model is trained using historical Superstore data to make accurate sales predictions for new records.

Data Preprocessing:
Various preprocessing techniques were applied, including:
1. Handling missing values
2. Outlier treatment
3. Encoding categorical variables

Algorithms Used:
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Tree Regression
3. Random Forest Regression
4. Support Vector Regression
5. XGBoost

Model Evaluation:
The best-performing model was evaluated using R Sqauared(R-2) Score.
